# **Gallstone Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning**

## 🩺 Overview
This project explores whether routinely available clinical and laboratory features can predict the presence of gallstones before imaging.

---

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- n = 1,098  
- Features: demographics, body composition, lab results  
- Target: gallstone presence (binary)

---

## 🤖 Methods
- Logistic Regression (L1)
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- SHAP interpretability
- SMOTE for class imbalance

---

## ⭐ Key Results
XGBoost achieved an **ROC-AUC of 0.87**, outperforming baseline and linear models.
